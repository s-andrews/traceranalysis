# Traceranalysis (FluxFix)

## About
Read [this](https://github.com/sophietrefely/traceranalysis/blob/master/How%20to%20use%20tracernalysis.docx) for detailed info.

## Web based tool
See [our website](http://www.fluxfix.science) for the web-based tool, and information about what it does.

## Batch processing
If you are interested in batch processing, the following steps are what you need

 1. Clone this repository (sorry no pip yet)
 2. Install the dependencies in website/requirements.txt (`pip3 -r requirements.txt`)
 3. Run `python3 example.py`, which uses our back-end code on a piece of sample data
 4. Take inspiration from example.py for your batch script: copy traceranalysis.py to the dir where your code is and re-work example.py until it does what you want.

Feel free to raise issues if something does not work as intended or if you would like an additional feature.
