		<h2>Tracer Analysis Tool</h2>

		<form method="post" action="analysis">
			<div class="averages">
				<p>Data from tracer experiments using isotope labeled metabolites (eg 13C glucose) must be normalized to natural isotopologue distribution. This tool will quickly and reliably transform raw mass spec AUC values into the percent representation of each isotopologue measured.<p>

				<h3> 1. Enter unlabeled data:</h3>

				<p>Enter the unlabeled data for your chosen metabolite in the box below. This data is used for normalisation.**<p>

				<p>NOTE: Data should be entered as comma seperated values with each row on a new line. Paste in NUMERICAL VALUES ONLY. Do not paste in the column and row headers.<p>

				</p>
				<textarea rows="2" cols="50" placeholder="Paste your unlabeled data here as comma seperated values"></textarea>
			</div>

				<h3>2. Enter your full data set:</h3>
				 

			<div class="data">
				<p>Enter the data for your chosen metabolite in the box below. Use the same format as you did for the unlabeled data and make sure the number of columns is consistent.</p>
				<textarea rows="10" cols="50" placeholder="Paste your CSV data here as a matrix"></textarea>
			</div>
			<button class="compute" type="submit">Compute Percentages</button>

			<p>Data formatting:<p>
				 Data should be organised into separate columns for each isotopologue measured and separate rows for each replicate sample. <p>


				<p>**It is recommended that you normalise to control data from samples that did not contain an isotope label. If you do not have unlabeled data, you can use theoretical isotopologue distribution values for normalisation. These values can be derived for specific metabolites using software tools such as XcaliburQuan (Thermo) or .... <p>
